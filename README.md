# Alzheimer's Disease Classification

This project focuses on developing machine learning models to classify Alzheimer's disease using patient demographic, lifestyle, and clinical data. The project includes comprehensive data analysis, feature engineering, and the implementation of various machine learning models to predict Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for data processing and model implementation
- **Pandas**: Data analysis and manipulation library
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing library
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for model implementation and evaluation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Visualization libraries for data analysis and results presentation
- **XGBoost**: Gradient boosting framework for model implementation
- **LightGBM**: Lightweight gradient boosting framework
- **CatBoost**: Gradient boosting framework with categorical feature support

## Project Details

- **Dataset**: The dataset contains comprehensive patient information including:
  - Demographic data (Age, Gender, Ethnicity)
  - Lifestyle factors (BMI, Smoking, Alcohol Consumption, Physical Activity, Diet Quality)
  - Clinical symptoms (Memory Complaints, Behavioral Problems, ADL, Confusion, etc.)
  - Diagnosis information

- **Model Implementation**:
  - Data preprocessing and feature engineering
  - Implementation of multiple machine learning models
  - Model evaluation and comparison
  - Feature importance analysis
  - Performance metrics calculation

# Alzheimer's Disease Classification

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to classify Alzheimer's disease from brain imaging data. The model utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for feature extraction, Quantum Neural Networks (QNN) for enhanced decision-making, and an ensemble of Swin Transformer models (Swin Tiny, Swin Small, Swin Base) for improved generalization.

The project aims to showcase how AI and deep learning can assist in the early detection of Alzheimer's disease, enabling timely interventions and treatments.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for data processing and model implementation.
- **TensorFlow**: Deep learning framework for building the CNN and Swin Transformer models.
- **Keras**: High-level neural network API used for model creation and training.
- **Qiskit**: Quantum computing library used to implement Quantum Neural Networks (QNN).
- **Swin Transformer**: An ensemble of Swin Transformer models (Swin Tiny, Swin Small, Swin Base) for image classification.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing library used for data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib**: Visualization library used for plotting graphs and metrics.
- **Pandas**: Data analysis and manipulation library used for handling datasets.

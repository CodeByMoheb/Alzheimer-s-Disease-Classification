# Alzheimer-s-Disease-Classification
This project involves developing a machine learning model for classifying Alzheimer’s disease from brain imaging data. The model uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for feature extraction, Quantum Neural Networks (QNN) for improved decision how AI can be used in healthcare to assist in the early detection of Alzheimer’s disease.
